## Hackweek Organization 

This repo contains a series of issues that document tasks necessary for organizing a hackweek. Each issue should relate to one specific, self-contained task. We then use the issues to populate a GitHub project management page. This [Kanban-style](https://zapier.com/learn/project-management/project-management-systems/#kanban) approach allows organizers to track activities and keep everything organized in the lead-up to the event.
